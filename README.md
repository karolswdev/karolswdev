# 👋 Hey, I'm Karol
## Architect. Linguist. Builder of systems that matter.

**From life-critical medical devices to living game worlds. 28 years of building systems across domains most engineers never touch.**

### 🤝 Let's Connect

I love building things and talking shop about:
- System architecture at scale
- Game engine internals
- Developer experience optimization
- Linguistics & natural language processing
- Anything involving paramotors or telescopes

**📫 Open to collaboration, consulting, or just nerding out over complex systems.**
