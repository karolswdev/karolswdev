# 👤 Bio

I was born in 🇵🇱Poland and spent the majority of my life in my home country. I have lived in: 🇵🇱Poland, 🇧🇪Belgium, 🇭🇺Hungary, USA.

My first programming experience was on **Amiga 500** together with the ASM language for its Motorola 68000 processor. I started experimenting with writing simple software at the age of 11. I was featured in a national newspaper after a user of a lottery program that I wrote and shared on **BBS** won a significant sum of money using the randomly generated numbers my program provided.

After a number of years and getting a PC I moved on to **C linux** programming. Notably, I created a number of applications based on the *curses* library for every day tasks such as to-do, calendar management and code management.

Having built up confidence and understanding of programming languages I participated in a number of game related projects. I created and managed several **Ultima Online** emulated servers. Over the years I created a comprehensive code base that has had thousands of players playing on.

I obtained a *BA degree* in **Linguistics** from the Akademia Pomorska university in 🇵🇱Poland. I complimented this with a *MA degree* in **Sociology** from the K.U. Leuven, in 🇧🇪Belgium. During my university years I was employed as an **English teacher** for adults. This job has given me insights that are helpful in my day-to-day engineering tasks.

My professional career started in 🇧🇪Belgium. I was employed as:

* **Automation Engineer**
* **.NET Engineer**
* **Senior .NET Engineer**

In 2013 I created a consulting company on the side that has been an extra income source for me ever since.

In 2017 I was given the opportunity to move to the 🇺🇸United States. I have been employed as a **Senior Software Engineer** by a medical company based in Denver.

In my free time I like to learn languages. I speak 🇵🇱**Polish**, 🇺🇸**English**, 🇧🇪 **Dutch**, 🇩🇪**German**, 🇸🇪**Swedish** and 🇷🇺**Russian**. 

Another passion of mine is 🏎motorsport. I am an avid **Formula One** fan, as well as a hobby racer (go-karts, low-powered open formulae) and virtual racer (GT Sport, **Top 100** in NA).
